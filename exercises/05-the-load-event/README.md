# `05` The load Event

It is a very good practice to wait for the browser to finish loading the page before starting the flow of your website/application, to do so, we use the LOAD event.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Create a function called `loadListener` that listens to the `load` event and alerts the string "loading finished..." when called.

## 💡 Hint:

- The listener has to be assigned to the body.
