# `07` Count onclick

If you have global variables, you can change their value during runtime using event handlers. For example, this code is increasing the value of the `counter` variable every time the user clicks on the **Increase** button.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a decrease button with an event handler function. The function should decrease the `counter` variable and update the number on screen.
