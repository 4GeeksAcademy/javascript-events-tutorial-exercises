Fill the calculateSumListener function with the code needed to print the sum of the values of the first two inputs into the third one.

Hint:
When you get the value of an input, it is recommended to parse the value as an integer with the function parseInt. That way you make sure that the result of 2 + 2 is 4, instead of 22. If you are getting 22 as a result, it means that the value of the input is being treated as strings instead of integers.
