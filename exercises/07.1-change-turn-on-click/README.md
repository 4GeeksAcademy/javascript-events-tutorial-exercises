# `07.1` Change Turn on Click

Let's say that you want to create a turn-changer tool to switch turns between two players: Mario and Juan.

For that, we have created the global variable `currentUser` and stored the current player name in that variable, then updated the value of that variable every time the button is clicked to the other player's name.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Change the code of the `turnChanger` function to add a third player called "Josh"

## 💡 Hint:

+ Add an `else if` condition asking for either Juan or Josh and change the value of `currentUser` variable accordingly.
