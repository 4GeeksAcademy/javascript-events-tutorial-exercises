Let's say that you want to create a turn-changer tool to switch turns between two players: Mario and Juan.

For that, we created the global variable currentPlayer and stored the current player name in that variable, and updated the value of that variable on each button click to the other player's name.

Instructions
Change the code of the turnChanger function to add a third player called "Josh"

Hint
Add an else if condition asking for either Juan or Josh and change the value of currentUser accordingly.
