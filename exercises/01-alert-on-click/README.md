# `01` Alert onclick

You can set Event Listener functions to handle any kind of events. The list of possible events is huge! Click, Double Click, Mouseover, Load, Print, etc... 

In this HTML code there are 2 buttons: one of them has `myClickFunction` as a listener assigned to the click event using the `onclick` event.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Add that same function as an Event Listener to the click event in #button2.

### 💡 Hint: 

Use the tag property called "onclick" just like in the other button.
