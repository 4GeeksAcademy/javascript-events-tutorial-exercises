# Hello World

You can have just a README file and it will be like a page in a book, no code files.

You can also add a `README.[lang].md` file for translations, for example: `README.es.md` for spanish.

## Video compatibility

If you want to include some video introduction for each exercise, add a `intro` property in the markdown frontmatter of the README.md for that particular exercise:

```markdown
---
intro: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8"
---
```

You can also add a video solution for each exercise by adding a `tutorial` property on the markdown frontmatter of it's README.md:


```markdown
---
intro: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8"
tutorial: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8"
---
```
