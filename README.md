This tutorial its part of a bigger group of tutorials about web development, this repository focuses only on Javascript Events, you will learn Mouse Events, Keyboard events, Frame Events and how to react to those events to make your web application interactive.

You can [start the tutorial online](#one-click-installation) in just 10 seconds or [download the source files](#local-installation) to do it locally.

I strongly recommend doing this tutorials in this order:

1. [Introduction to HTML](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course)
2. [Introduction to CSS](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course)
3. [Introduction to Javascript](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial)
4. [Introduction to The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises)
5. [Using events & The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises) ‚Üê you are here now üî•
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises)

## Local Installation

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2. Download this particular exercise using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```
$ learnpack download javascript-events-tutorial-exercises
$ cd javascript-events-tutorial-exercises
```

Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
1. **index.html:** represents the entry website.
1. **style.css:** your website styles, they have to be imported from the index.html
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
